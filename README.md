# Smart Livestream PoC

Local proof of concept for a smart livestream system that combines face recognition and gesture recognition.

## Scope

- Open webcam stream locally.
- Register users by capturing webcam face samples.
- Generate face embeddings with InsightFace.
- Store each user embedding as a separate `.npy` file.
- Keep `users.json` as a lightweight local index only.
- Recognize registered users in real time.
- Display `Unknown` for unregistered faces.
- Detect `Raise Hand` and `Thumbs Up` with MediaPipe Hands.
- Wave gesture is temporarily disabled (`ENABLE_WAVE_GESTURE=false`).
- Render username, gesture effects, and FPS overlays with OpenCV.
- Write application logs to `logs/app.log`.

No database, web app, cloud service, Docker, message queue, authentication, or additional AI model is used in this phase.

## Architecture

`main.py` orchestrates the application. It wires together camera input, face recognition, gesture detection, overlays, and logging.

`face_registration` owns webcam-based user registration. It captures multiple face samples for one user, averages the embeddings, and saves the result.

`face_recognition` owns InsightFace model loading, face detection, embedding generation, cosine similarity matching, and local embedding persistence.

`gesture_detection` owns MediaPipe Hands inference and lightweight heuristic gesture classification. Gesture effects are global in this PoC and are not assigned to a specific recognized user.

`overlay_engine` owns all OpenCV drawing logic, including face boxes, usernames, `Unknown`, gesture effects, and the FPS monitor.

`storage` stores local user data. Each user has one `.npy` embedding file. `users.json` stores metadata and file names only.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1

1. Open webcam stream.
2. Register a user with multiple face samples.
3. Generate InsightFace embeddings.
4. Average and normalize embeddings.
5. Save the embedding as `storage/embeddings/<username>.npy`.
6. Save metadata in `storage/embeddings/users.json`.
7. Recognize registered users from webcam frames.

### Phase 2

1. Run MediaPipe Hands on webcam frames.
2. Detect `Raise Hand` based on hand landmark height.
3. Detect `Raise Hand` and `Thumbs Up` with MediaPipe Hands.
4. Wave gesture is temporarily disabled. Set `ENABLE_WAVE_GESTURE=true` to re-enable it.
5. Render global gesture effects.
6. Render username and FPS overlays.

### Phase 3

1. Improve multi-face throughput.
2. Tune frame resolution and recognition thresholds.
3. Add optional recognition throttling if needed.
4. Improve gesture heuristics or train a dedicated gesture model in a future phase.

## Setup

Use Python 3.11 or newer.

```bash
cd smart-livestream-poc
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

InsightFace may download its model files on first use.

## Run Locally

Register a user:

```bash
python main.py register --username alice
```

Run real-time recognition and gesture detection:

```bash
python main.py run
```

List registered users:

```bash
python main.py list-users
```

Delete a user:

```bash
python main.py delete-user --username alice
```

Press `Q` or `ESC` to stop webcam windows.

## Configuration

Most tunable values live in `config/settings.py`, including:

- Camera index and resolution.
- InsightFace model name and recognition threshold.
- Registration sample count.
- MediaPipe confidence thresholds.
- Gesture detection thresholds.
- Overlay style.
- Local storage and log paths.

## Docker (Web Dashboard)

Run the web dashboard/control plane with Docker Compose:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:5173
- Backend API: http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Primary demo path: Browser AR (local FaceLandmarker)

The main demo at `/` runs **Browser AR** entirely in the browser:

- Webcam via `getUserMedia()` on the host
- Face landmarks and effects via MediaPipe **FaceLandmarker** (`@mediapipe/tasks-vision`)
- Effect presets: None, Glasses, Makeup Lite, Full Filter
- Optional debug overlay (FPS, inference timing)

The backend is used for **dashboard services**: chat, AI Event Feed, face registration API, and future identity/events integration — not for rendering the main camera preview.

Shared AR code lives in `frontend/src/features/browser-ar/`. Benchmark harness: `/poc/ar-lab`.

### Optional legacy backend camera APIs

These remain for tests and reference; the **main demo** uses Browser AR in the frontend:

| Path | Status |
|------|--------|
| `POST /api/inference/frame` | Legacy — backend-inferred overlays in browser |
| `GET /video-feed` | Legacy — MJPEG stream with backend OpenCV capture |
| CLI `python main.py run` | Original local OpenCV PoC (not part of web demo) |

See [docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md) for environment variables, production profile, and troubleshooting.

Local scripts (`scripts/start-backend.ps1`, `npm run dev`) remain supported without Docker.
